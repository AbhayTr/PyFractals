Description: # PyFractals
        
        ## Visualising the equation which revolutionized maths!
        
        Python Module which creates the fractals design.
        
        ## Mandelbrot equation: 
        
        **ƒ(z) = z² + c** where **c is any complex number** is used to make the famous mandel brot fractals.
        
        It can show the fractals design by:
        
        - Plotting the fractals design on graph.
        - Save the fractals design as an image file.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Simply using PyPi: 
        
        ```
        pip install pyfractals
        ```
        ## Usage
        
        Simply run the following python code:
        
        ```python
        from pyfractals import MandelBrot
        
        MandelBrot(mode = "image/graph", optional_params)
        ```
        
        Thats it!
        
        ## Parameters
        
        - **mode (Required):** Specifies how one wants to visualize the fractals design, "image" for saving the design as a picture file, "graph" for plotting the design on graph.
        - **accuracy_factor (Optional):** Greater the accuracy_factor, more detailed is the fractals design and more processing power and time is required (Defualt: 1000).
        - **save_file_path (Optional):** If mode is set to "image", then this specefies the path were the image file has to be saved (Default: Same as your python file).
        
        So go ahead and enjoy the beautiful and complex MandelBrot Fractals Design!
